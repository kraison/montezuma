     This manual describes the `local-time' Common Lisp library which is
     based on Erik Naggum's  _The Long, Painful History of Time_
     [NaggumPaper] paper.


1 Introduction
**************

The `local-time' library is a Common Lisp library for the manipulation
of dates, times and intervals. It was originally based almost entirely
upon Erik Naggum's paper _The Long Painful History of Time_
[NaggumPaper].  Many of the core concepts originated from this paper,
such as the seperation of days and seconds, the choice of 2000-03-01 as
the standard epoch, and the timestring format.

     Caveats: This implementation assumes that time zone information is
     stored in the tzfile format. The default timezone is loaded from
     /etc/localtime. On non-POSIX systems, this will certainly give
     different results than the system time handling.

2 Public API
************

2.1 Types
=========

It's a good idea to treat all values as immutable objects. `local-time'
will not modify any object it was given unless explicitly asked to by
the `:into' keyword argument.

 -- Class: timestamp day sec nsec
     `timestamp' values can represent either a _date_, a _daytime_ or a
     _time_ value. It has the following slots:

       (defclass timestamp ()
         ((day :type integer)
          (sec :type integer)
          (nsec :type (integer 0 999999999))))

     The following constraints apply to the specific types:
        * _date_: must have a +UTC-ZONE+ timezone and the SEC slot must
          be the first second of a day; In other words, the time
          elements of the `timestamp' value must have their least
          possible values.

        * _time_: the DAY slot must be zero.


 -- Struct: timezone path name loaded
     `timezone' objects represent timezones - local and political
     modifications to the time representation.  Timezones are
     responsible for storing offsets from GMT, abbreviations for
     different sub-timezones, and the times each sub-timezone is to be
     in effect.


2.2 Timezones
=============

 -- Default: *default-timezone*
     The variable *DEFAULT-TIMEZONE* contains the timezone that will be
     used by default if none is specified.  It is loaded from
     _/etc/localtime_ when the library is loaded.  If _/etc/localtime_
     is not present, it will default to UTC.


 -- Constant: +utc-time+
     The variable +UTC-ZONE+ contains a timezone corresponding to UTC.


 -- Macro: define-timezone zone-name zone-file &key (load nil)
     Define ZONE-NAME (a symbol or a string) as a new timezone,
     lazy-loaded from ZONE-FILE (a pathname designator relative to the
     zoneinfo directory on this system.  If LOAD is true, load
     immediately.


2.3 Creating `timestamp' Objects
================================

 -- Function: universal-to-timestamp universal &key (nsec 0)
     Produces a `timestamp' instance from the provided universal time
     UNIVERSAL.  Universal time is defined in the Common Lisp
     Specification as the number of seconds since 1900-01-01T00:00:00Z.

 -- Function: unix-to-timestamp unix &key (nsec 0)
     Produces a `timestamp' instance from the provided unix time UNIX.
     Unix time is defined by POSIX as the number of seconds since
     1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

 -- Function: now
     Produces a `timestamp' instance with the current time.  Under
     sbcl, the new timestamp will be precise to the microsecond.
     Otherwise, the precision is limited to the second.

 -- Function: today
     Produces a `timestamp' instance that corresponds to today's date,
     which is the midnight of the current day in the UTC zone.

 -- Function: encode-timestamp nsec sec minute hour day month year &key
          timezone offset into
     Returns a new `timestamp' instance corresponding to the specified
     time elements.  The OFFSET is the number of seconds offset from
     UTC of the locale.  If OFFSET is not specified, the offset will be
     guessed from the TIMEZONE.  If a `timestamp' is passed as the INTO
     argument, its value will be set and that `timestamp' will be
     returned.  Otherwise, a new `timestamp' is created.

 -- Macro: make-timestamp &key :day :sec :nsec
     Expands to an expression that creates an instance of a `timestamp'
     exactly as specified.

 -- Macro: clone-timestamp timestamp
     Expands to an expression that creates another copy of TIMESTAMP
     that is `timestamp=' to it.

2.4 Querying `timestamp' Objects
================================

 -- Function: day-of timestamp
     Returns the day component of TIMESTAMP.  Although Naggum's paper
     specifies that the day should be a signed fixnum, it is left
     unbounded for flexibility reasons.

 -- Function: sec-of timestamp
     Returns the 'seconds' component of the time.  Valid values for the
     seconds range from 0 to 86399.

 -- Function: nsec-of timestamp
     Returns the 'microseconds' component of the time.  Valid values for
     the nanoseconds range from 0 to 999999999.

 -- Function: timestamp-to-universal timestamp
     This returns the date/time specified in TIMESTAMP encoded as the
     number of seconds since January 1st, 1900 12:00am UTC.

 -- Function: timestamp-to-unix timestamp
     This returns the date/time specified in TIMESTAMP encoded as the
     number of seconds since January 1st, 1970 12:00am UTC.  It
     corresponds with the time received from the POSIX call `time()'.

 -- Function: timestamp-subtimezone timestamp timezone
     Returns as multiple values the time zone applicable at the given
     time as the number of seconds east of UTC, a boolean
     daylight-saving-p, and the customary abbreviation of the timezone.

 -- Macro: with-decoded-timestamp (&key nsec sec minute hour day month
          year day-of-week daylight-p timezone) timestamp &body body
     This macro binds variables to the decoded elements of TIMESTAMP.
     The timezone argument is used for decoding the timestamp, and is
     not bound by the macro. The value of DAY-OF-WEEK starts from 0
     which means Sunday.

 -- Function: decode-timestamp timestamp
     Returns the decoded time as `(values ns ss mm hh day month year
     day-of-week daylight-saving-time-p timezone-offset
     timezone-abbreviation)'.

 -- Function: timestamp< time-a time-b
 -- Function: timestamp<= time-a time-b
 -- Function: timestamp> time-a time-b
 -- Function: timestamp>= time-a time-b
 -- Function: timestamp= time-a time-b
 -- Function: timestamp/= time-a time-b
     These comparison functions act like their string and char
     counterparts.

 -- Function: timestamp-minimum timestamp &rest timestamps
     Returns the earliest timestamp passed to it.

 -- Function: timestamp-maximum timestamp &rest timestamps
     Returns the latest timestamp passed to it.

 -- Function: timestamp-day-of-week timestamp
     This returns the index of the day of the week, starting at 0 which
     means Sunday.

          Note: "Day of the week" is ambigous and locale dependent.

 -- Function: universal-to-timestamp timestamp
     Returns the UNIVERSAL-TIME corresponding to TIMESTAMP.

          Note: Subsecond precision is not preserved.

 -- Function: timestamp-millennium timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-century timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-decade timestamp &key timezone
     Returns the ordinal millennium, century or decade upon which the
     timestamp falls.  Ordinal time values start at 1, so the
     (timestamp-century (now)) will return 21.


 -- Function: timestamp-year timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-month timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-day timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-hour timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-minute timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-second timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-millisecond timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-microsecond timestamp &key timezone
 -- Function: timestamp-microsecond timestamp &key timezone
     Returns the decoded part of the timestamp.

2.5 Manipulating Date and Time Values
=====================================

 -- Function: timestamp+ time amount unit
 -- Function: timestamp- time amount unit
     Add or subtract the AMOUNT to the TIME using the specified UNIT.
     UNIT may be one of ( `:nsec' `:sec' `:minute' `:hour' `:day'
     `:month' `:year').  The value of the parts of the timestamp of
     higher resolution than the UNIT will never be touched.  If you
     want a precise number of seconds from a time, you should specify
     the offset in seconds.

 -- Function: timestamp-maximize-part timestamp part &key offset
          timezone into
     Returns a timestamp with its parts maximized up to PART.  PART can
     be any of (:nsec :sec :min :hour :day :month).  If INTO is
     specified, it will be modified and returned, otherwise a new
     timestamp will be created.

 -- Function: timestamp-minimize-part timestamp part &key offset
          timezone into
     Returns a timestamp with its parts minimized up to PART.  PART can
     be any of (:nsec :sec :min :hour :day :month).  If INTO is
     specified, it will be modified and returned, otherwise a new
     timestamp will be created.

 -- Macro: adjust-timestamp timestamp &body changes
     Alters various parts of TIMESTAMP, given a list of changes.  The
     changes are in the format `(offset part value)' and `(set part
     value)'.

       ;; Return a new `timestamp' value that points to the previous Monday
       (adjust-timestamp (today) (offset :day-of-week :monday))

       ;; Return a new `timestamp' value that points three days ahead from now
       (adjust-timestamp (today) (offset :day 3))

     Keep in mind that `adjust-timestamp' is not a mere setter for
     fields but instead it handles overflows and timezone conversions as
     expected. Also note that it's possible to specify multiple
     commands.

     The list of possible places to manipulate are: `:nsec' `:sec'
     `:sec-of-day' `:minute' `:hour' `:day' `:day-of-month' `:month'
     `:year'.

 -- Macro: adjust-timestamp! timestamp &body changes
     Just like `adjust-timestamp', but instead of returning a freshly
     constructed value, it alters the provided TIMESTAMP value (and
     returns it).

 -- Function: timestamp-whole-year-difference time-a time-b
     Returns the number of whole years elapsed between TIME-A and
     TIME-B.

          Note: This is useful for calculating anniversaries and
          birthdays.

 -- Function: days-in-month month year
     Returns the number of days in a given month of the specified year.

2.6 Parsing and Formatting
==========================

 -- Constant: +iso-8601-format+
     The constant +ISO-8601-FORMAT+ is bound to a description of the
     ISO 8601 format.  An output with this format will look like this:
     `2008-03-01T19:42:34.608506+01:00'.  This is the default format
     for the `format-timestring' function.


 -- Constant: +asctime-format+
     The constant +ASCTIME-FORMAT+ is bound to a format mirroring the
     output of the POSIX asctime() function.  An output with this
     format will look like this: `Sat Mar  1 19:42:34 2008'.


 -- Constant: +rfc-1123-format+
     The constant +RFC-1123-FORMAT+ is bound to a description of the
     format defined in RFC 1123 for Internet timestamps.  An output
     with this format will look like this: `Sat, 01 Mar 2008 19:42:34
     EDT'.


 -- Constant: +iso-week-date-format+
     The constant +ISO-WEEK-DATE-FORMAT+ is bound to a description of
     the ISO 8601 Week Date format.  An output with this format will
     look like this: `2009-W53-5'.


 -- Function: parse-timestring timestring &key (start 0) end
          (fail-on-error t) (offset 0)
     Parses a timestring and returns the corresponding `timestamp'.
     Parsing begins at START and stops at the END position. If there
     are invalid characters within `timestring' and FAIL-ON-ERROR is
     `T', then an `invalid-timestring' error is signaled, otherwise
     `NIL' is returned.

     If there is no timezone specified in `timestring' then OFFSET is
     used as the default timezone offset (in seconds).

 -- Function: format-timestring (destination timestamp &key (format
          +iso-8601-format+) (timezone *default-timezone*))
     Constructs a string representation of TIMESTAMP according to
     FORMAT and returns it.  If destination is T, the string is written
     to *standard-output*.  If destination is a stream, the string is
     written to the stream.

     FORMAT is a list containing one or more of strings, characters,
     and keywords.  Strings and characters are output literally, while
     keywords are replaced by the values here:

    `:year'
          *year

    `:month'
          *numeric month

    `:day'
          *day of month

    `:weekday'
          *numeric day of week, starting from 0 which means Sunday

    `:hour'
          *hour

    `:min'
          *minutes

    `:sec'
          *seconds

    `:msec'
          *milliseconds

    `:usec'
          *microseconds

    `:nsec'
          *nanoseconds

    `:iso-week-year'
          *year for ISO week date (can be different from regular
          calendar year)

    `:iso-week-number'
          *ISO week number (i.e. 1 through 53)

    `:iso-week-day'
          *ISO compatible weekday number (i.e. monday=1, sunday=7)

    `:ordinal-day'
          day of month as an ordinal (e.g. 1st, 23rd)

    `:long-weekday'
          long form of weekday (e.g. Sunday, Monday)

    `:short-weekday'
          short form of weekday (e.g. Sun, Mon)

    `:long-month'
          long form of month (e.g. January, February)

    `:short-month'
          short form of month (e.g. Jan, Feb)

    `:hour12'
          hour on a 12-hour clock

    `:ampm'
          am/pm marker in lowercase

    `:gmt-offset'
          the gmt-offset of the time, in +00:00 form

    `:gmt-offset-or-z'
          like :gmt-offset, but is Z when UTC

    `:timezone'
          timezone abbrevation for the time

     Elements marked by * can be placed in a list in the form:
       (:keyword padding &optional (padchar #\0))
     The string representation of the value will be padded with the
     padchar.

     You can see examples by examining the values in +ISO-8601-FORMAT+,
     +ASCTIME-FORMAT+, and +RFC-1123-FORMAT+.

     Produces on STREAM the timestring corresponding to the TIMESTAMP
     with the given options.  If STREAM is `nil', only returns a string
     containing what would have been the output.  If STREAM is `t',
     prints the string to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

     Example output:
       LOCAL-TIME> (format-timestring nil (now))
       "2008-03-01T19:42:34.608506+01:00"

 -- Function: format-rfc3339-timestring (destination timestamp &key
          omit-date-part omit-time-part omit-timezone-part (use-zulu t))
     Formats the time like format-timestring, but in RFC 3339 format.
     The options control valid options in the RFC.

3 Other Features
